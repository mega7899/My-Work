                <p>It’s pretty universally understood that genre definitions in the video game space are tenuous at best and downright nonsensical at worst. What makes a game an RPG in 2024 when most mainstream releases have some kind of leveling and stats system? How are young people today supposed to know what descriptors like <i>“Metroidvania”,</i> <i>"Gacha"</i> or <i>“Soulsborne”</i> mean when the games that inspired those terms become increasingly obtuse and comparisons to those games are evoked as often in marketing pushes as they are in reviews?</p>
                <p>Now, add a whole other, and equally varied, artistic medium into the mix and you get the <i>“anime game” </i>genre; which is colloquial nonsense! Genres are supposed to give casual consumers a general idea of what they can expect from a title, and allow critics to trace back the lineage and inspiration informing the mechanical and narrative direction of a work. An anime game could be anything from a super casual mobile game where you do gacha pulls for cute characters, or one of the crunchiest role playing games on the market. </p>
                <p>Having such a spectrum of content bundled under a growingly common moniker isn’t helpful to anyone, so here’s a taxonomy of the different kinds of games that all fall under the <i>“anime game”</i> umbrella term. </p>

                <b style="text-align: center"> 2. Honkai Star Rail </b>
            <p class = "size"><i>Honkai: Star Rail</i> is a role-playing gacha video game developed by miHoYo, published by miHoYo in mainland China and worldwide by COGNOSPHERE, d/b/a HoYoverse. It is miHoYo's first turn-based game, featuring the main character, who is referred to as the Trailblazer, travelling across worlds through the Astral Express to help and connect the worlds while resolving disasters caused by "Stellarons" and other third-parties. The first closed beta test was launched on October 27, 2021. It was publicly released internationally on April 26, 2023,[3] for Windows and mobile devices. Additionally, the PlayStation 5 port was released on October 11, 2023. The PlayStation 4 version is still yet to be announced, as revealed at the latest Summer Game Fest with a trailer.[4] It is the fourth installment in the Honkai series, utilizing some characters from Honkai Impact 3rd and some gameplay elements from miHoYo's previous action RPG, Genshin Impact.</p>
            <p class = "size">Honkai: Star Rail began development in 2019 with the goal of "exploring new directions for the Honkai series". The production team has about 500 people, most of whom are fans of science fiction works and turn-based role-playing games. This project is HoYoverse’s first attempt at a turn-based combat mechanism game. The team has stated that this genre is very popular in the game market and can lower the difficulty threshold for players to get started. In previous surveys conducted by HoYoverse, many players expressed that they enjoy this type of game. There were concerns about whether this type of game is too retro, but the production team believes that as long as the quality of the game is enjoyable, it can attract players.
            Like other works in the Honkai series, it is in no way "too hard-core science fiction". The setting of Honkai Impact 3rd is Earth, but the plot mentioned that there were other planets in this worldview. Therefore, the production team of Honkai: Star Rail decided to expand on this concept of "a universe". The basic setting revolves around taking a train and traveling around the major planets in the universe. The production of each planet in the game takes around one year. The production sequence is to first determine the worldview and theme of the planet, then create the characters and detailed setting information, and then finally write the plot. The design of the planet "Xianzhou Luofu" is based on East Asian fantasy, and has been described as <i>"silkpunk".</i></p>
